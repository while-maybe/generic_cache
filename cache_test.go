TestCache is an integration test.

- Create a cache and check that it is empty?
- Upsert a new key <5, fünf> in the cache
- Read the value for this entry
- Upsert for the same entry with the new value
- Read the new value
- Upsert another key <3, drei> and check that is doesn't override
- Delete 5 and check that 3 still exists
